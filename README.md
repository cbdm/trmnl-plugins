# trmnl-plugins

Repo containing plugins I created for my [trmnl](https://usetrmnl.com/) display.

## nhl-next-team-game

This plugins uses [puckdex](https://github.com/cbdm/puckdex)'s [next API](https://puckdex.cbdm.app/docs) to display the next (home/away/any) game for the appropriate team.  
The files in the folder are exported from trmnl's dashboard, but I first used [trmnl_preview](https://github.com/schrockwell/trmnl_preview) to understand how to get the data into the display.
